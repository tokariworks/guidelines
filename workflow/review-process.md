# Review Process

A structured review process maintains narrative quality and team alignment.

## 1. Submission

- Writers submit drafts as pull requests against `develop`.  
- Include summary and specific review requests.

## 2. Reviewers

- Assigned reviewers include Narrative Editors and Systems Writers (if logic is involved).  
- At least two reviewers per PR.

## 3. Feedback

- Provide inline, actionable comments categorized by type: `[voice]`, `[logic]`, `[pacing]`, `[format]`.  
- Engage in discussion threads to resolve issues.

## 4. Revision

- Writers respond to feedback via commits.  
- Mark comments as resolved after changes.

## 5. Approval & Merge

- Once all feedback is addressed and reviewers approve, PR can be merged.  
- Label PR as `approved` and update changelog accordingly.
