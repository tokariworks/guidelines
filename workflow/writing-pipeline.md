# Writing Pipeline

This document outlines the narrative production workflow used at Tokari Works. It defines each phase in the lifecycle of a visual novel script — from concept to implementation — ensuring clarity, collaboration, and quality control.

## 1. Planning & Conceptualization

- Define high-level premise, tone, genre, and core themes.
- Identify major characters, arcs, and emotional milestones.
- Structure acts and key narrative beats.
- Output: Narrative Concept Document (NCD)

## 2. Scene Mapping

- Break narrative into modular scenes.
- Assign narrative function to each scene (exposition, tension, resolution, etc.).
- Establish branching logic or dependencies.
- Output: Scene Map & Flow Diagram

## 3. Drafting

- Write scenes in script format using approved conventions.
- Integrate dialogue, choices, state logic, and non-verbal cues.
- Flag uncertain beats or optional variants.
- Output: First Draft Scripts

## 4. Internal Review

- Peer feedback focusing on character voice, tone, and thematic strength.
- Track issues via review tags and inline comments.
- Revise content iteratively.
- Output: Clean Draft v2+

## 5. Technical Adaptation

- Finalize markup for Ren'Py or engine-specific syntax.
- Integrate metadata (scene labels, choice flags, variables).
- Sync with programmers for system constraints.
- Output: Implementation-Ready Scripts

## 6. Integration & QA

- Import script into build.
- Perform narrative QA (continuity, logic, pacing).
- Cross-test for edge cases and branching integrity.
- Output: Verified In-Engine Narrative
