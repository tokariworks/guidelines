# Quality Assurance (QA) in Narrative Production

Quality Assurance (QA) ensures the narrative is coherent, polished, and free of logical or technical errors before release.

## 1. QA Objectives

- Verify narrative continuity and character consistency.  
- Confirm branching logic integrity and variable state correctness.  
- Identify pacing issues, tonal inconsistencies, and dead-ends.  
- Test localization placeholders and text display.

## 2. QA Workflow

- Narrative QA specialists execute scripted playthroughs covering all major branches.  
- Use checklist-driven testing, with documented issues filed via GitHub.  
- Collaborate with narrative writers, programmers, and translators to fix bugs.  
- Re-test fixes to confirm resolution.

## 3. Tools and Reporting

- Use issue trackers for bug logging with clear reproduction steps.  
- Maintain QA test cases and result logs.  
- Integrate automated tests where feasible (e.g., syntax checks, script parsers).
