# Guidelines

This repository defines the narrative principles and storytelling methodology adopted by Tokari Works in the creation of visual novels.

At Tokari Works, we treat story not just as entertainment, but as system a structure designed to be felt. Our writing process aims to balance psychological depth, tonal consistency, and emotional control across branching narrative paths.

These guidelines serve as an evolving foundation for internal projects and collaborative development. While tailored to our own design goals, they may also be valuable to other creators exploring narrative-driven interactive fiction.

## Philosophy

We approach narrative structure as emotional architecture stories built with intentional pacing, layered choices, and character-driven causality. Dialogue is not filler; it’s momentum. Every scene exists for a reason. Every moment has weight.

> 「物語は、ただ読むものではない。それは感じる構造だ。」
