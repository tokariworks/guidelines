# Emotional Tagging

Emotional tagging is the process of annotating narrative elements with emotional metadata to enhance adaptive storytelling, player feedback, and dynamic content adjustment.

## 1. Purpose of Emotional Tagging

- Capture the emotional tone or intensity of dialogue, scenes, or choices.  
- Enable dynamic narrative responses tailored to player emotional state or relationship metrics.  
- Support analytics on emotional engagement and pacing.

## 2. Tagging Methods

- **Explicit Tags**  
  Use predefined labels such as `[anger]`, `[joy]`, `[tension]`, `[melancholy]` embedded in script comments or metadata.

- **Intensity Scales**  
  Assign numeric values or levels (e.g., 1â€“5) to represent emotional intensity.

- **Composite Tags**  
  Combine multiple emotions or layered tags (e.g., `[joy+surprise]`).

## 3. Integration with Narrative Systems

- Emotional tags influence dialogue variations, character reactions, and event triggers.  
- Tags feed into relationship and mood state machines to modify future scenes.  
- Enable adaptive music, sound effects, or visual cues based on tagged emotional content.

## 4. Best Practices

- Define a standardized emotional tag taxonomy for consistency across projects.  
- Document tag meanings, usage guidelines, and examples.  
- Train writers and editors on emotional tagging importance and application.  
- Review tagged content regularly for accuracy and narrative coherence.

## 5. Challenges

- Avoid over-tagging that dilutes meaning or complicates system logic.  
- Balance objective tagging with creative flexibility and narrative nuance.
