# Dialogue Scripting

Dialogue scripting is the backbone of character interaction and narrative delivery in visual novels. High-quality dialogue scripting ensures clarity, natural flow, and emotional impact.

## 1. Structure and Format

- Use consistent syntax according to the engine (e.g., Ren'Py conventions).  
- Separate speaker tags clearly from dialogue text.  
- Include stage directions and non-verbal cues inline or as comments.  
- Mark choices, branches, and conditional dialogue explicitly.

## 2. Character Voice and Tone

- Maintain distinct voice profiles for each character (formal, casual, sarcastic, etc.).  
- Reflect character emotions and personality in dialogue style and word choice.  
- Use subtext and implication to enrich conversations beyond literal meaning.

## 3. Pacing and Flow

- Balance dialogue length to avoid overwhelming or boring the player.  
- Use pauses, ellipses, and line breaks strategically to create rhythm.  
- Alternate between dialogue, narration, and player choices for engagement.

## 4. Dynamic and Conditional Dialogue

- Implement conditionals to show different lines based on player choices or states.  
- Support dialogue variations for relationship levels, emotional states, or plot progression.  
- Use variables and flags to track dialogue history and prevent repetition.

## 5. Localization and Accessibility

- Write clear and translatable dialogue avoiding idioms or culture-specific references unless justified.  
- Use consistent terminology for key concepts and character names.  
- Provide descriptions for sound effects, background changes, or character expressions as needed.

## 6. Best Practices

- Document dialogue blocks with scene and character context.  
- Keep dialogues concise but meaningful.  
- Review dialogue flow in playtesting sessions to ensure natural interaction.  
- Collaborate closely with voice actors (if applicable) and narrative editors.
