# Choice Design

Choices are pivotal interactive elements that shape player agency and narrative branching in visual novels. Effective choice design balances meaningful impact with clarity and emotional resonance.

## 1. Purpose of Choices

- Empower players to influence story direction or character relationships.  
- Reinforce themes and emotional beats through player decisions.  
- Introduce variability and replayability without fragmenting narrative cohesion.

## 2. Types of Choices

- **Binary Choices**  
  Simple yes/no or two-option decisions; useful for clear moral or emotional dilemmas.

- **Multiple-Choice Options**  
  Provide nuanced alternatives that can reflect personality, tone, or strategic approach.

- **Hidden Choices**  
  Options that appear only under specific conditions, rewarding exploration or prior actions.

- **Timed Choices**  
  Choices that require player input within a limited timeframe, increasing tension or realism.

## 3. Designing Impactful Choices

- **Clarity**: Ensure choice text is unambiguous and contextually clear.  
- **Consequence**: Choices should have logical and perceivable outcomes, immediate or delayed.  
- **Balance**: Avoid overwhelming players with too many choices or meaningless decisions.  
- **Emotional Weight**: Align choices with character motivations and narrative stakes.

## 4. Branching and State Integration

- Connect choices to state variables and flags that influence future scenes.  
- Use conditions to unlock or modify choices based on previous player actions.  
- Maintain a clear mapping of choice consequences to avoid narrative contradictions.

## 5. Accessibility Considerations

- Avoid overly complex or rapid choice sequences that may hinder player comprehension.  
- Provide consistent visual and textual cues for choice availability and selection.

## 6. Best Practices

- Playtest choices for flow, clarity, and impact.  
- Document choice nodes with descriptions, triggers, and expected results.  
- Use modular choice structures to simplify updates and revisions.  
- Integrate feedback from narrative editors and QA to refine decision points.
