# Collaboration Principles

Effective collaboration is fundamental to Tokari Works' success in creating impactful visual novels. This document outlines the guiding principles that govern teamwork, communication, and interdisciplinary integration within the studio.

## 1. Cross-Disciplinary Respect

Recognize and value the expertise of all team members â€” writers, programmers, artists, sound designers, and producers. Each discipline contributes uniquely to the narrative experience and must be integrated harmoniously.

## 2. Clear Communication Channels

Establish transparent, consistent communication protocols:

- Use centralized platforms for project updates and documentation.
- Schedule regular sync meetings to align goals and resolve blockers.
- Encourage open feedback loops, fostering a safe environment for constructive criticism.

## 3. Shared Narrative Vision

Maintain a unified understanding of the narrative goals:

- Distribute comprehensive design documents accessible to all members.
- Promote discussions that clarify thematic intent and emotional targets.
- Revisit and refine narrative scope collaboratively throughout development.

## 4. Iterative Workflow

Adopt an iterative approach where:

- Drafts and prototypes are shared early and often.
- Feedback is timely, specific, and actionable.
- Flexibility is maintained to incorporate creative insights and technical constraints.

## 5. Role Clarity and Ownership

Define responsibilities clearly to avoid overlaps and gaps:

- Writers focus on story, character, and dialogue.
- Programmers implement systems supporting narrative logic.
- Artists create assets aligned with story tone and atmosphere.
- Producers coordinate schedules and resource allocation.

Each member takes ownership of their domain while supporting collective goals.

## 6. Conflict Resolution

Handle disagreements professionally:

- Address issues promptly through direct communication.
- Seek consensus through data-driven or narrative-focused arguments.
- Escalate to leadership only when necessary, ensuring respect and fairness.

## 7. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

Maintain up-to-date documentation:

- Record decisions, changes, and rationales in shared repositories.
- Use version control to track narrative and codebase evolution.
- Encourage sharing of resources, research, and inspirations.

By adhering to these principles, Tokari Works fosters a productive, creative, and respectful environment where narrative excellence and technical quality thrive in harmony.
