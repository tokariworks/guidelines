# Accessibility

Tokari Works is committed to creating visual novels that are inclusive and accessible to a wide range of players. Accessibility is a core design consideration that ensures narrative experiences are available regardless of physical, cognitive, or sensory differences.

## 1. Visual Accessibility

- **High Contrast Options**: Provide alternative color schemes with sufficient contrast for text and UI elements to aid players with visual impairments.  
- **Scalable Text**: Allow dynamic resizing of fonts without breaking UI layout.  
- **Clear Typography**: Use legible fonts with distinguishable characters and avoid overly decorative styles.

## 2. Audio Accessibility

- **Subtitles and Closed Captions**: Include complete, synchronized text captions for all dialogue, sound effects, and important audio cues.  
- **Volume Controls**: Enable independent volume adjustments for music, dialogue, and sound effects.  
- **Alternative Cues**: Provide visual or textual alternatives for important audio feedback.

## 3. Cognitive Accessibility

- **Consistent UI Layouts**: Maintain predictable interfaces to reduce cognitive load.  
- **Simplified Language Options**: Offer language modes with simplified vocabulary and grammar for easier comprehension.  
- **Adjustable Reading Speed**: Allow players to control text display speed or opt for manual progression.

## 4. Motor Accessibility

- **Input Flexibility**: Support multiple input methods (keyboard, controller, touch) with customizable key bindings.  
- **Reduced Input Demand**: Minimize the need for rapid or complex input sequences.  
- **Pause and Resume**: Allow players to pause, save, and resume at any point without penalty.

## 5. Inclusivity and Representation

- **Diverse Character Options**: Include varied representation in character designs and narratives to reflect a broad audience.  
- **Respectful Depictions**: Avoid stereotypes and handle sensitive topics with nuance and care.

By embedding accessibility into every stage of development, Tokari Works ensures its visual novels are welcoming, engaging, and enjoyable for all players.
