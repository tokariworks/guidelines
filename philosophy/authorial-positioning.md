# Authorial Positioning

At Tokari Works, authorial positioning is understood as a conscious stance that shapes narrative intent, ethical responsibility, and audience engagement. This document clarifies the role of the creative team in mediating story, emotion, and meaning within visual novels.

## 1. Narrative Intent as Authorial Voice

The authorial voice is the guiding consciousness behind the story’s architecture. It governs:

- The thematic direction and moral framing.
- The balance between player agency and narrative control.
- The emotional registers and tonal consistency.

This voice is neither intrusive nor invisible; it is calibrated to maintain immersion while shaping player experience toward intended insights.

## 2. Ethical Responsibility

Creators bear responsibility for the psychological impact of their narratives. Tokari Works commits to:

- Handling sensitive topics with care and nuance.
- Avoiding gratuitous content that serves no narrative purpose.
- Providing players with agency to navigate complex emotional landscapes.

Ethical storytelling enhances trust and deepens engagement.

## 3. Managing Narrative Distance

Authorial positioning involves calibrating narrative distance—the space between story and player perception. This includes:

- Employing perspective shifts to modulate empathy and objectivity.
- Using meta-narrative elements sparingly to provoke reflection without breaking immersion.
- Balancing immediacy with contemplation to optimize emotional pacing.

## 4. Transparency and Player Autonomy

Transparency about narrative mechanics and themes respects player agency. This entails:

- Signaling when difficult content or choices arise.
- Allowing players to make informed decisions about engagement.
- Designing meaningful consequences that reflect player input.

## 5. Collaboration and Iteration

Authorial positioning is not static. It evolves through:

- Collaborative feedback among writers, designers, and players.
- Iterative refinement based on emotional impact analysis.
- Openness to challenging conventions to deepen narrative complexity.

Tokari Works views the authorial role as both architect and steward — crafting experiences that are purposeful, respectful, and resonant.
