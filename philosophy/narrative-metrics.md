# Narrative Metrics

Measuring narrative quality and emotional impact is essential for Tokari Works to ensure stories resonate effectively with players. This document outlines key metrics, evaluation methods, and analysis techniques applicable throughout the development lifecycle.

## 1. Emotional Impact Metrics

Track quantitative and qualitative indicators that represent player emotional engagement:

- **Tension Curve**: Visualize intensity over time to identify pacing issues (peaks, valleys, plateaus).  
- **Empathy Index**: Measure alignment between player perspective and character emotional states via surveys or behavioral analysis.  
- **Emotional Slope**: Rate of emotional change within scenes or across acts to assess momentum.

## 2. Narrative Coherence

Evaluate the logical and thematic consistency of story elements:

- **Branch Reachability**: Percentage of narrative branches that are accessed or remain unused during playtests.  
- **Conflict Resolution Ratio**: Balance between introduced conflicts and their resolutions, ensuring satisfying closure.  
- **Thematic Alignment Score**: Degree to which scenes, dialogue, and choices reinforce core narrative themes.

## 3. Player Engagement Indicators

Assess player interaction and retention related to narrative elements:

- **Choice Impact Variance**: Measure how significantly player decisions affect story outcomes.  
- **Re-engagement Rate**: Frequency of players replaying to explore alternate branches.  
- **Narrative Drop-off Points**: Identify where players lose interest or disengage.

## 4. Feedback Collection Methods

Implement structured approaches to gather data:

- **Playtesting Sessions**: Observe and record player reactions in controlled environments.  
- **Surveys and Interviews**: Collect subjective impressions regarding emotional and narrative satisfaction.  
- **Telemetry Data**: Log in-game choices, timing, and progression for quantitative analysis.

## 5. Analytical Tools and Visualization

Use software tools to represent and interpret narrative data:

- Narrative graph visualization for branch analysis.  
- Emotional pacing charts plotting tension and release cycles.  
- Heatmaps indicating player choice distribution.

## 6. Iterative Application

Integrate metrics into development cycles:

- Use data to prioritize narrative revisions and content adjustments.  
- Track changes across versions to monitor improvement.  
- Establish benchmarks for future projects based on historical data.

By rigorously applying these metrics, Tokari Works ensures its visual novels maintain structural integrity, emotional resonance, and player engagement at the highest standard.
