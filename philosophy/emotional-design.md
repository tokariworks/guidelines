# Emotional Design

Tokari Works approaches emotional design as a deliberate process of crafting player experience through calibrated affective stimuli. Our goal is to engage players not only cognitively but viscerally, guiding their emotional journey with precision and intention.

## 1. Emotional Trajectory Mapping

Every narrative segment is designed with an emotional trajectory in mind â€” a planned progression of affective states that modulate tension, empathy, and release. These trajectories balance peaks and valleys to avoid fatigue or disengagement.

- Identify target emotions per scene (e.g., anxiety, relief, sorrow).
- Plan transitions that feel natural yet impactful.
- Use emotional pacing charts or graphs to visualize shifts over time.

## 2. Modulation Techniques

To maintain engagement, emotional intensity must be modulated. Techniques include:

- Contrast: juxtaposing high-intensity scenes with quieter moments.
- Variation: alternating emotional tones to prevent monotony.
- Repetition with variation: reinforcing themes while evolving emotional context.

## 3. Emotional Anchors

Key moments serve as anchors that ground player investment. These anchors may be:

- Character revelations that shift understanding.
- Critical choices that generate tension.
- Symbolic imagery that evokes subconscious response.

Anchors should be spaced to sustain attention and provide meaningful payoffs.

## 4. Player Empathy Engineering

Design aims to foster empathy by aligning player perspective with character emotional states without forcing identification.

- Use perspective shifts strategically to deepen understanding.
- Avoid oversimplification; maintain character complexity.
- Employ narrative distance where appropriate to manage emotional overload.

## 5. Emotional Feedback Loops

Interactive elements provide feedback that reinforces emotional states, such as:

- Visual or auditory cues tied to player decisions.
- Dynamic narrative responses reflecting player input.
- Subtle state changes that accumulate over time.

These loops enhance immersion and create a sense of agency tied to emotional consequence.

## 6. Ethical Considerations in Emotional Design

Given the emotional weight of our narratives, Tokari Works adheres to ethical standards:

- Avoid manipulation that induces harm or distress without narrative justification.
- Provide context and support for difficult themes.
- Respect player autonomy by offering meaningful choices and clear consequences.

Emotional design at Tokari Works is not ancillary; it is integral. The architecture of feeling guides the mechanics of story, creating narratives that resonate deeply and endure beyond gameplay.
