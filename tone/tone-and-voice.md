# Tone and Voice

Tokari Works establishes a distinct narrative tone and authorial voice to create immersive, emotionally resonant visual novels. This document defines the overarching stylistic principles that guide all written content.

## 1. Narrative Tone

- **Emotionally Grounded**: The tone balances sincerity and subtlety, favoring nuanced emotional expression over melodrama.  
- **Reflective and Thoughtful**: Encourages introspection and thematic depth, inviting players to engage intellectually and emotionally.  
- **Consistent but Flexible**: Maintains tonal coherence while adapting to scene context—shifting naturally between tension, warmth, melancholy, or hope.

## 2. Authorial Voice

- **Calibrated Presence**: The narrator’s voice is neither intrusive nor detached but guides the player with clarity and empathy.  
- **Purposeful Ambiguity**: Leaves room for player interpretation, avoiding heavy-handed explanations.  
- **Respectful and Mature**: Treats characters and themes with dignity, fostering trust and deeper engagement.

## 3. Style Guidelines

- Use precise, evocative language avoiding clichés and excessive exposition.  
- Prefer showing over telling; rely on imagery, subtext, and character actions to convey meaning.  
- Maintain readability with clear sentence structure and varied rhythm.
