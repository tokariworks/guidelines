# Narrative Perspective

Tokari Works carefully selects and maintains narrative perspectives to shape player immersion and emotional connection.

## 1. Point of View (POV)

- Use **first-person** when intimacy and subjective experience are paramount.  
- Use **third-person limited** to balance character insight with narrative scope.  
- Avoid head-hopping to maintain clarity and immersion.

## 2. Focalization

- Anchor perspective to a primary character per scene or chapter.  
- Employ shifts deliberately to reveal differing viewpoints or unreliable narration.

## 3. Narrative Reliability

- Define the narratorâ€™s reliability level early, influencing player trust and engagement.  
- Use unreliable narration sparingly and purposefully for thematic effect.
