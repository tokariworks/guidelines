# Language Register

Language register defines the formality and style appropriate for the narrative world and characters.

## 1. Formality Levels

- Match register to setting, character background, and context (e.g., formal for academia, casual for youth).  
- Maintain internal consistency unless a shift serves characterization or plot.

## 2. Vocabulary and Syntax

- Use accessible yet expressive vocabulary.  
- Avoid anachronisms or overly complex constructions unless intentional stylistic choices.

## 3. Slang and Dialects

- Incorporate slang judiciously to enhance authenticity without alienating players.  
- Use dialects carefully to avoid caricature and maintain readability.
