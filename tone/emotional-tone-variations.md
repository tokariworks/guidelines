# Emotional Tone Variations

Adjusting emotional tone dynamically sustains player engagement and narrative depth.

## 1. Tone Shifts

- Use gradual shifts for subtle mood changes.  
- Employ abrupt shifts to surprise or emphasize dramatic moments.

## 2. Balancing Contrast

- Contrast heavy emotional scenes with lighter moments to prevent fatigue.  
- Use humor, warmth, or calm to provide relief and humanize characters.

## 3. Maintaining Cohesion

- Ensure tonal shifts align with narrative logic and character arcs.  
- Avoid inconsistent or jarring transitions that disrupt immersion.
