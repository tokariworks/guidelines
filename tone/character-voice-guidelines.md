# Character Voice Guidelines

Consistent and distinctive character voices are essential for believable storytelling. Tokari Worksâ€™ guidelines ensure each character communicates authentically and supports narrative goals.

## 1. Defining Voice

- **Personality Anchors**: Establish core traits (e.g., confident, shy, sarcastic) that shape speech patterns and vocabulary.  
- **Cultural and Contextual Nuances**: Incorporate background, social status, and setting influences on dialogue style.  
- **Emotional Range**: Reflect character development and situational changes through shifts in tone and language.

## 2. Dialogue Consistency

- Maintain vocabulary and idiomatic expressions unique to each character.  
- Avoid sudden, unexplained shifts in speech style unless motivated by narrative.  
- Use dialogue tags and action beats to reinforce tone and intention.

## 3. Diversity and Representation

- Respect cultural authenticity and avoid stereotypes.  
- Use inclusive language and consider varied perspectives.  
- Reflect internal conflicts and growth through evolving speech patterns.
