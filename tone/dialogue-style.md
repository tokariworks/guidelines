# Dialogue Style

Dialogue is a primary vehicle for storytelling in visual novels. Tokari Worksâ€™ dialogue style emphasizes naturalness, clarity, and emotional impact.

## 1. Natural Flow

- Write dialogue that mimics real speech rhythms while maintaining narrative economy.  
- Use contractions, interruptions, and pauses to create authenticity.  
- Avoid overloading dialogue with exposition.

## 2. Emotional Subtext

- Embed subtext and layered meaning beneath surface conversations.  
- Use silence, hesitation, and non-verbal cues as narrative tools.  
- Ensure dialogue advances plot or deepens character understanding.

## 3. Pacing and Variation

- Balance fast-paced exchanges with slower, reflective moments.  
- Vary sentence length and structure to maintain reader interest.  
- Use dialogue to control scene tension and release.
