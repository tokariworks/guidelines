# Scene Transitions

Scene transitions maintain narrative flow and emotional rhythm. Tokari Works defines transitions as intentional narrative connectors, not just visual or mechanical changes.

## 1. Transition Types

- **Temporal**: Passages in time (hours, days, seasons).  
- **Spatial**: Changes in setting or location.  
- **Emotional**: Shifts in mood, tension, or tone.  
- **Perspective**: Movement between characters or narrative viewpoints.

## 2. Transition Cues

Use cues to signal shifts clearly without breaking immersion:

- Visual indicators (fade-in/out, light changes, filters).  
- Dialogue anchors (e.g., reflective monologue, trailing off, call to action).  
- Sound design (musical cues, ambient fade, silence).

## 3. Maintaining Continuity

- Transitions must preserve emotional contextâ€”avoid abrupt tonal dissonance.  
- Ensure narrative logic between scenes; motivation and consequence should carry over.  
- Design transitions to support player retention by respecting rhythm and mental state.
