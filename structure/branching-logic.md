# Branching Logic

Branching structure is a defining feature of visual novels. Tokari Works treats each branch not as a detour but as a fully integrated part of the narrative system.

## 1. Node Architecture

Each choice creates a new node in the narrative graph, defined by:

- **Input Conditions**: Narrative or emotional prerequisites to activate a choice.  
- **Output Effects**: Changes to global or character state, emotional trajectory, or scene availability.  
- **Visibility**: Whether the choice is hidden, unlocked, or context-sensitive.

## 2. Choice Design

- Ensure all choices are meaningful â€” reflecting moral, emotional, or thematic tension.  
- Vary choice impact: not all decisions need binary outcomes; some should alter tone, pacing, or future dialogue subtly.

## 3. Structural Patterns

- Use **branch-and-return** when exploration is thematic, but resolution converges.  
- Use **divergent arcs** when player agency alters narrative identity.  
- Mark **irreversible pivots** clearly to emphasize stakes.

## 4. Integrity and Testing

- Test for unreachable branches, dead ends, or unintended loops.  
- Map complete narrative graphs to visualize cohesion and balance.
