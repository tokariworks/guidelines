# Scene Anatomy

Scenes are the fundamental narrative units in Tokari Works visual novels. Each scene must be structurally sound, emotionally purposeful, and contextually justified.

## 1. Core Components

- **Setup**: Establishes context — time, place, emotional tone, and character presence.  
- **Catalyst**: Introduces narrative motion — a question, tension, or internal shift.  
- **Beat Sequence**: Contains escalating emotional or informational developments.  
- **Climax / Pivot**: The emotional or narrative high point.  
- **Resolution / Exit Point**: Closes the arc, reinforces theme, or redirects tension.

## 2. Purpose-Driven Design

Each scene must answer at least one of the following:

- Does it progress the plot?  
- Does it reveal character depth or growth?  
- Does it intensify or resolve tension?  
- Does it reinforce a theme?

If not, the scene should be revised or removed.

## 3. Scene Length and Rhythm

- Maintain a balance between pacing and depth.  
- Avoid redundancy; cut filler beats that do not serve function.  
- Use variation in length to control rhythm and tone.
