# Act Structure

Tokari Works employs a flexible act structure framework that organizes the narrative into emotionally and thematically distinct movements.

## 1. Act Functions

- **Act I – Foundation**  
  Introduces world, tone, key characters, and narrative stakes. Ends with a destabilizing event.

- **Act II – Expansion**  
  Deepens conflict, develops character arcs, and branches the narrative. Character decisions carry emotional consequence.

- **Act III – Convergence**  
  Collapses or resolves key threads, delivers payoff for player choices, and reinforces thematic closure.

## 2. Transitions and Pacing

- Transitions between acts must carry emotional momentum.  
- Avoid static pacing across acts; escalate stakes and deepen player involvement.  
- Ensure each act has its own mini-arc (setup > confrontation > resolution).

## 3. Variations

- Nonlinear acts may be used when thematic recursion or fragmentation is narratively justified.  
- Optional side acts should still echo the core structure and emotional rhythm.
