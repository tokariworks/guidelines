# Narrative Arcs

Narrative arcs represent the structural progression of tension, transformation, and resolution across the story. Tokari Works uses arcs to define emotional, thematic, and character-driven movement throughout the visual novel.

## 1. Types of Arcs

- **Character Arc**  
  Tracks a character’s internal change in belief, motivation, or identity.

- **Thematic Arc**  
  Evolves the central idea explored across the plot, shaped by contrast, reinforcement, and resolution.

- **Relational Arc**  
  Follows the evolution of interpersonal dynamics between characters.

- **Plot Arc**  
  Represents the external progression of events, obstacles, and outcomes.

## 2. Structural Mapping

Each arc should be:

- **Planned across acts** to ensure consistent emotional development.  
- **Intertwined**: Arcs reinforce one another—character change should impact plot, and vice versa.  
- **Documented**: Use progression charts or beat maps to track stages (e.g., belief > challenge > collapse > shift > integration).

## 3. Arc Resolution

- Avoid premature resolution; tension must earn its payoff.  
- Some arcs may remain open-ended if thematically justified.  
- Player influence should modify arc resolution without compromising core narrative integrity.
