# Emergent Structure

Emergent structure arises when the narrative form adapts dynamically to player behavior, rather than following rigid pre-authored tracks. Tokari Works explores emergence to deepen personalization and systemic narrative design.

## 1. Foundations of Emergence

- Based on **player-driven state accumulation** over time.  
- Uses **systems of influence** rather than linear branching (e.g., trust levels, emotional tags).  
- Prioritizes **recontextualization**: scenes gain new meaning based on prior input.

## 2. Implementation Patterns

- **Floating Nodes**: Scene modules activated by state rather than sequence.  
- **Narrative Reweaving**: Dialogue and events subtly reshape based on cumulative emotional tone.  
- **Decentralized Progression**: Players construct thematic meaning from scattered, personalized sequences.

## 3. Risks and Controls

- Guard against narrative incoherence through robust fallback logic.  
- Require comprehensive documentation of emergent triggers.  
- Use analytics to test and refine outcomes.

Emergent structures challenge traditional narrative forms, but when crafted intentionally, they enable stories that feel deeply personalâ€”written by the player as much as by the author.
